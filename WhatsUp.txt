Respected Sir,
I am writing to express my interest in the QA Automation Engineer position as advertised. With a solid background in software quality assurance and extensive experience in automation testing, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team and help ensure the delivery of high-quality software products.
In my previous role, I was responsible for designing, developing, and implementing automated test scripts using industry-leading tools such as Selenium, BDD and TestNG. I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to identify test requirements, create comprehensive test plans, and execute test cases efficiently, resulting in a significant reduction in manual testing efforts and faster time-to-market for our products.
I am proficient in programming languages such as Java and Python, which enables me to develop scalable and maintainable test automation frameworks.
Beyond technical skills, I possess strong analytical abilities and a keen eye for detail, allowing me to identify defects early in the development lifecycle and work proactively to prevent their recurrence. I am also a team player with excellent communication skills, capable of effectively conveying technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Thank you for considering my application. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the needs of your team further. I am available at your earliest convenience for an interview 
Thank You
